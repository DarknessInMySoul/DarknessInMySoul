Hi, my name is Paul, I am 18 years old, I got into web developing and programming a few months ago, I had only one big project that I am actually proud of, you can find it in my repositories, I will never abandon that project, it is my heart and soul.
You can reach me on discord for support or if you need help with something, a proposal, etc. Paul.#5080. I currently know php, html, css and sql, but I plan to learn js, c#, c++, react.js, angular.js, unity, discord.js, vue.js, java etc. That seems like a lot, because it is, I hope to achieve this goal in a span of 1-2 years, I hope to master every one of them in that time. Good luck :D
